# whats-open-node
I made a node.js port of what-open, because I wanted a server which didn't require ugly hacks to send static files and because I wanted to get back in touch with Node.

To start the app, download, type "npm install" to install the packages, and then type "npm start". It should start on port 3000, and log the latitude and longitude of any requests.

Built using Hapi for the backend and Hyperapp, Webpack and JSX for the frontend.
